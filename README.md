# SkillsAndMore Genesis Dev Starter Theme

GitHub project link: https://github.com/skillsAndMore/sam-genesis-dev-starter.

# Getting Started
Right now we do not have any particular script that will run a search-replace for us, so it's better to know how to use this in your editor of choice and replace any instance of the following phrases:

[ * ] Search for "SkillsAndMore Genesis Dev Starter" and replace it with your theme name
[ * ] Search for "sam-dev-starter" and replace it with your theme slug
[ * ] Search for "sam_dev_" and replace it with your function prefix

Now that it's all done you can start downloading the npm packages that will let you use [WPGulp](https://github.com/ahmadawais/WPGulp).
`npm install`

## Nice to know
Remember to change the _screenshot.png_ image to reflect the new theme you're developing.

## More info coming soon, stay tuned
